Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

If you need a code review or feedback while you are developing the code just
create a pull request. You can add new commits to your branch as needed.

For merging, your request would need to:

1. Include unit tests that are passing (run ``py.test``).
2. Update documentation as needed for new API, functionality etc. 
3. Add a note to ``CHANGELOG.rst`` about the changes.
4. Add your name to ``AUTHORS.rst``.


Test tips
---------

To run a subset of test functions containing test_myfeature in their name use::

    py.test -k test_myfeature

To run tests verbosely, displaying all print statements to terminal::

    py.test  -vvs
